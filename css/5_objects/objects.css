You are inside:

5 - Objects
Following the principles of OOCSs (object-oriented CSS), here is where we will have our little "objects", 
which are nothing more than small pieces of the interface, in general, patterns that are repeated throughout 
the site and who may have or not a visual layer above.
We only use classes here. It is where we begin to declare the structure of our elements.
Here is where we make the patterns of buttons, lists, panels, etc. At that time, only the use of classes are 
also allowed.
